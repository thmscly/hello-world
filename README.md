# hello-world
This is a preliminary, introductory project as introduced by the infamous GitHub.
I'm more or less new to programming, and am really excited about learning, coding, and potentially throwing my laptop across the room out of bottomless rage-spair (that's "rage" + "despair." It's quite lovely this time of year). I do photography, am a (un-terrible/un-mind-blowing) multi-instrumentalist, I love movies, and I have a B.S. in Psychology. Emphasis on the "B.S." I've done lots of work in the non-profit and recreation sectors, and am looking for something with a little more room for growth, creativity, and career options. So, here I am.
